# About
I am **Computational Biologist** interested in phenotypic drug discovery and functional genomics. I obtained my PhD in the lab of Prof. Michael Boutros at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg (https://www.dkfz.de/en/signaling-and-functional-genomics). Throughout my career I have generated and analyzed several large-scale (> 100k conditions) data sets from **high-content screening** campaigns. I further analyzed RNAseq data sets and worked on the integration of multi-omics with imaging data.

Below you will find the cloned repositories of the original repositories used for publications (e.g. HTSvis, Supp_Heigwer_2021, Supp_Schubert_2021) and some repositories from personal projects.
